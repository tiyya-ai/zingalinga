## Impact

### âœ… What Still Works
- **Package Pricing**: Bundle/package pricing remains fully functional
- **Content Upload**: Video and audio content upload works without pricing
- **Content Management**: All content management features preserved
- **User Experience**: Cleaner, simpler upload forms

### ðŸš« What Was Removed
- Individual video pricing during upload
- Individual audio lesson pricing
- Price display in content management tables
- Price-related form validation for individual content

## Business Logic Change

**Before:** Content could be priced individually + sold in packages
**After:** Content is only available through package purchases

This aligns with a package-based business model where:
- Individual content has no standalone price
- All content is bundled into packages
- Packages have their own pricing structure
- Users must purchase packages to access content

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/ModernAdminDashboard.tsx` - Main video upload form
2. `src/components/AudioLessonsManager.tsx` - Audio lesson management
3. `src/utils/uploadUtils.ts` - Upload utility functions
4. `src/components/EnhancedUploadQueue.tsx` - Upload queue component
5. Various interface and type definition files
6. Data structure files

## Technical Benefits

- **Simplified Codebase**: Removed 1,333 lines of pricing-related code
- **Cleaner UI**: Streamlined upload forms without pricing complexity
- **Consistent Business Model**: All content access through packages only
- **Reduced Maintenance**: Fewer pricing-related bugs and edge cases
- **Better UX**: Simpler content creation workflow for admins

## Next Steps

The application now fully supports a package-only pricing model. Content creators can focus on creating quality content without worrying about individual pricing, while the package system handles all monetization.
