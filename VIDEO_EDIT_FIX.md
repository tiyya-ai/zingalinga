# Video Editing Issues Fix

## Problems Identified:
1. Cover images not showing when editing videos
2. Video content not visible during editing - only showing YouTube-like titles
3. Video preview not working properly in edit mode

## Root Causes:
1. **Blob URL handling**: When videos are uploaded as files, they create blob URLs that aren't properly persisted
2. **Thumbnail display**: Cover images aren't being properly loaded in the edit form
3. **Video preview**: The video preview in edit mode isn't handling different video types correctly
4. **Data persistence**: Blob URLs are temporary and get revoked, causing videos to disappear

## Solutions Applied:

### 1. Fixed Video URL Handling
- Improved blob URL to base64 conversion for persistence
- Added proper cleanup of blob URLs
- Enhanced video type detection and handling

### 2. Fixed Thumbnail Display
- Added proper thumbnail loading in edit mode
- Improved error handling for broken image URLs
- Added fallback thumbnail display

### 3. Enhanced Video Preview
- Fixed video preview for different video types (YouTube, Vimeo, uploaded files)
- Added proper iframe handling for external videos
- Improved video player for uploaded files

### 4. Improved Data Persistence
- Convert blob URLs to base64 for permanent storage
- Proper cleanup of temporary URLs
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

## Files Modified:
- ModernAdminDashboard.tsx (video editing functionality)
- Video handling utilities
- Data persistence layer

## Testing Steps:
1. Upload a video file - should show proper preview
2. Add a cover image - should display correctly
3. Edit an existing video - should show current thumbnail and video
4. Save changes - should persist properly
5. Reload page - video and thumbnail should still be available
