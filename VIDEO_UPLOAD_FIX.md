# Video Upload Fix Applied ðŸŽ¥

## Problem
Videos uploaded from PC were not playing on admin or user dashboard because blob URLs don't persist after page refresh.

## Solution
Changed video upload to use base64 encoding instead of blob URLs for persistent storage.

## What Changed
- `handleFileUpload` function now converts video files to base64
- Videos are stored as data URLs that persist across sessions
- Maintains all existing functionality (duration detection, progress tracking)

## Test Steps
1. Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Add Video â†’ File Upload
2. Upload a video file from your PC
3. Video should show "Upload successful!" 
4. Save the video
5. Video should now play correctly in both admin and user dashboards
6. Video should still work after page refresh

## Technical Details
- Videos are converted to base64 data URLs
- Persistent storage in database
- Compatible with all video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV, WebM)
- No external dependencies required

The fix ensures uploaded videos work permanently! âœ…
